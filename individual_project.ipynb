    "# 2. Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Broad question: \n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific question: \n",
    "To what extent do game engagement (measured by played_hours), age and gender predict newsletter subscription behaviour, and do these effects vary across different player experience levels?  \n",

    "#### Description:  \n",
    "The players.csv dataset can help me address the question. I will solve the question using two graphs, one is bar chart and one is scatter plot. For the bar chart, I will select gender as my explanatory variable and subscribe as my response variable. Then use the bar chart to find the proportion of subscription for different genders across various player types, and compare to find which gender tends to have more subscription. For the scatter plot, I will select played_hours and Age as my explanatory variables, and subscribe as my response variable. Then I will ignore the unknown values (NA) in the dataset. After that, I will plot a scatter plot with played_hours on x-axis and Age on y-axis and use two different colour for subscribe or not (True of False) to compare the charateristics of subscription behaviour across various player types."
